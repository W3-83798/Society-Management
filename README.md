# Society-Management
<b>Introduction -</b>

Hii all, my name is Shriyash Thakare, As our PG Project we have selected topic of "Society Management System".

<b>Project Objective -</b>

The Project is developed to demonstrate the learning obtained during the course and resolve the issue of Buyers. In my project we have Implementing a User Friendly Web Application. designed to help manage the day-to-day operation of residential socities , housing complexes, or gated communities it aims to simplify and automate the management of residential socities.

<b>Project Description - ( coming to Technologies..)</b>

The project is developed by in react as its frontend using node as a platform which is a library of JS, where are handling the client facing request and portal design.

for database we have ued MYSql to store our society, secretary, owner and other related details. for the backend we have choosen ExpressJs, NodeJs. NodeJS Is open source , cross platform JS runtime environment. Backend APIs it handle routing and CORS is used to restrict resources on a web server based on the origin of the request.

<b>For Security we have use JsonWebToken And SHA256 Hashing algorithum.

CryptoJS is used to handle cryptographic operations such as hashing and encryption.</b>

After completing the backend development, I designed and built a comprehensive society management system using ReactJS, featuring three distinct dashboards: Admin, Secretary, and Owner.

The Admin dashboard, which is unique to each society, serves as the central hub for managing societies and their respective secretaries. From this dashboard, administrators can add new societies and assign secretaries to manage them. However, to prevent data inconsistencies, administrators cannot delete societies that have already been assigned a secretary. The Secretary dashboard is where secretaries can add new owners to their respective societies, assigning each owner a unique ID. This allows owners to access information specific to their society, including amenities and announcements. Finally, the Owner dashboard provides a personalized view, displaying only the owner's relevant information, announcements, and amenities that have been added by their secretary. This ensures that owners can easily access the information they need, while maintaining the security and integrity of the system. Owner Which Are potential User on the portal. when the owner Navigates to the portal, they can login in by Using Email and password as a method of Authentication and Password Encyption. The provided user credentials are verified with the credentials stored in the database. on successfull authentication, the Owner is navigated to the Owner's dashboard.
